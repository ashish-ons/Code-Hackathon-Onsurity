1) Create a 3-Tier Web App using NodeJS/Maven [any one Technology] [Sample application is also fine]
2) Dockerize the 3-Tier Web App

3) Create a Jenkins/Teamcity/GoCD pipeline script
   a) Introduce different stages in Jenkins Pipeline
   b) WebHook Integration, Pull Code, Push Events with GitHUb or GitLab or BitBucket  [Any one is fine]
   c) Stages to Dockerize the code and push to ECR/DockerHUB/ACR [Any one is fine]
   d) Stages to Deploy to Kubernetes using Ansible

4) Use Terraform to provision Kuberenetes cluster
5) Setup a Alerts using SNS and Lambda function when your Kubernetes Cluster Provisioning gets completed [Use Python/NodeJS/Shell/Bash (any one scripting)]



Note** - The above scenario if failing is fine, but should be able to complete this tasks.
         1) Please create the public repo and upload this code.
         2) Send us the link of the GITHUB/GITLAB/BitBucket

Please try to use best practices to showcase whats in your mind.
